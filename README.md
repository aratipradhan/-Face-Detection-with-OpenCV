# Face-Detection-with-OpenCV

I just completed a project on Face Detection using Python and OpenCV! 🖥️📸 This implementation leverages the Haar Cascade Classifier for real-time and static image face detection. Here's a quick breakdown:
✅ Loaded an image using OpenCV and verified successful input.
✅ Used a pre-trained Haar Cascade model (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) to detect faces in an image.
✅ Dynamically added rectangles around each detected face and labeled them as "Face" above the bounding box.
✅ Ensured the display is optimized for screen resolution by resizing the image for better visualization.
